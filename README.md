The project is confirmed to not trigger a traditional CURECreview. Legal and ethical aspects are considered for the projectdesign.  Recreating a person’s voice is at the intersectionof copyright, impersonation and property rights. There hasbeen precedent in the US [1] regarding this topic. To ad-dress the legal aspects, there is a fair-use exemption [2] thatapplies to the project. The project is for non-commercial re-search purposes and all music will be obtained legally i.e.paid for and downloaded through legal avenues. As the projectcreates deepfakes, without the singer’s consent or knowl-edge, the project has ethical implications. As it is difficultto connect with the singer’s selected for the project, a fewadditional constraints will be applied to the project.

1. Converting maximum of 50 seconds only of the songto simply test the software, rather than deliver a fullyconverted audio.
2. Making it clear within the tool that the conversion isfor personal use only, not for publishing or distribu-tion.
3. Results are to be stored in github repository for show-ing them to the reviewers.
4. Stating the project is for academic purposes only, onlyshowing the codes and results of some seconds.
